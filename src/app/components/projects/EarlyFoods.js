              Think about Instagram—some people are a bit wary about buying
              stuff online because of bad experiences on other platforms. It
              gets even trickier when it's about health, especially for
              themselves and their kids. So, we need to figure out how to make
              them feel comfy and trust us right from the start.

                Hi I am Rachana. I am from Neemuch but I live in Bangalore. My
                family was neither too open but mother has been always
                supportive and because of her I have achieved a lot of things in
                my life. I have done graduation and a diploma in hospitality. I
                have learned a lot from my career as I used to keep changing my
                jobs. I started my own business as well in Gurgaon. My business
                was my achievement I was so proud of and now being a mother is
                my another achievement as I love this phase of my life. I have a
                small and beautiful family of a baby boy, my dog, and my
                husband. I love doing DIY projects, painting, and traveling.
                Thanks
